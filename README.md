# crypto-prices
I just wanted a front-end that would use the data I store in my database that uses crypto price data I am getting with my new scrubbing program.

The data likely won't be up-to-date unless I decide to collect the data continually for some reason. 

I've included very specific information about when the data was current so as not to cause any confusion.
